# Keyboard layouts

There are many more layouts than the ones I discussed, but I'm sticking to the alternative ones I've studied.

- **1932 - Dvorak**
  - Positioned vowels in the same row
  - Speed up typing, lessen errors
  - Favours the right hand
  - [Dvorak training](https://learn.dvorak.nl/)
- **2006 - Colemak**
  - Only 17 characters moved from QWERTY
  - Ctrl C/X/V are in the same place
  - More balanced with the hands
  - [Colemak home](https://colemak.com/)
- **2010 - Workman**
  - Focused on the "HE" bigram
  - Had concerns about Colemak
  - Low finger travel
  - [Workman layout](https://workmanlayout.org/)
- **2014 - Colemak-DH**
  - Same issues with Workman but modifies coleman a bit
  - One of the better layouts in terms of finger travel
  - [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/)
