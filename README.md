# Thicc Thocc Click Clack: History and Science of Keyboards

This repo is a supplement to my DDDPerth conference talk with the same title. Feel free to have a look and read through the resources I have amassed while researching for this talk.

I believe that there is so much more content as this rabbit hole goes very deep, so feel free to keep adding more via pull requests if you encounter some!

## Contents

I've organised this as much as I could by categorising them.

### Ergonomics

Mostly science papers on ergonomics that I have read. Ergonomics usually allude to hand positioning, prevention of injuries like RSI (repetitive strain injury) or CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome).

### Keyboards

This is one of the bigger rabbit holes but this section shows links to how specific keyboards were made - i.e. the journey of the creators from the initial problem to the actual solution.
