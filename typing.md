# Typing

No matter which you choose, IMO it's best to do this "scientifically" by first measuring your current typing speed (WPM).

Note that this is should not be the only measure you should be looking at, but more of a guide. Your typing speed will also vary depending on other factors like:

- **Reading speed**: I am a slow reader so I cannot accurately measure my typing speed when I'm actively measuring out vs if I'm typing out my thoughts or arguing with someone online
- **Hearing speed**: Some people type faster when it's dictated to them

I've noticed it also depends on the randomness of the words, like if I get a string of 5-8 letter words in succession vs a sentence of just 2-3 letter words, my typing speed and accuracy vastly differs.

## Typing sites that can teach you touch typing:

*Disclaimer: I am NOT an affiliate for any of these

- [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/): Has free and "step by step" courses to learn touch typing (will start you with the home row). It even has courses for Dvorak and Colemak
- [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/): Some schools actually use this to teach the kids to type!
- [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/): Smart way to learn touch typing. It gathers data on your actual skill levels and makes you focus on your weaker letters. It presents this in nice graphs and is also [open source](https://github.com/aradzie/keybr.com)!
    - I have personally used both Keybr and Typing Club in learning touch typing AND Colemak
- [Colemak Club](https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/): One of the sites that teach Colemak and Colemak-DH. Additionally it also does teach Dvorak, QWERTY, and Workman.
